# SmashdownBros

## About

### Purpose

While Nintendo created an incredible game, it's no secret that their online offerings leave a lot to be desired. This tool was inspired by a key game mode in Super Smash Bros Ultimate being unavailable in online play. While this idea has grown beyond the scope of that relatively straightforward game mode, the goal hasn't changed: attempt to fill this gap so everyone can enjoy  Smash online with their friends!

### Contributing

Would you like to contribute to the project? While I am not actively looking for assistance, if this project inspires you feel free to reach out and we can discuss. I am rather fond of 'giving back' so if you're still new to coding but have the self-driving passion, I'd be happy to mentor you as you help make changes to the project
